# practical question 

# 1] wrie a prigram to  ask the user  to enter their three movies  and store items into the list 

# movies = []

# mov1 = input("enter 1st movie :")
# mov2 = input("enter 2st movie :")
# mov3 = input("enter 3st movie :")

# movies.append(mov1)
# movies.append(mov2)
# movies.append(mov3)

# print(movies)
    
# another way to append 

# movies = []

# movies.append(input("enter 1st movie :"))
# movies.append(input("enter 1st movie :"))
# movies.append(input("enter 1st movie :"))

# print(movies)

# 2] palidrone value check 

# checkList = [1,2,3,2,1]
# copyl = checkList.copy()
# copyl.reverse()
# print(copyl)

# if checkList == copyl:
#     print("this list is palindrome")
# else:
#     print("this list is not palindrome")

# 3] find largest number in list 

# list = [13,45,34,23]

# findLargestNumber = max(list)
# print(findLargestNumber)

# 4] Count how many times a number appears in a list.
list = [1, 2, 2, 3, 2]
countlist = list.count(2)
print(countlist)
